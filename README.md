# Epistemology's Role in Human-AI Alignment: Designing Human-Centered and Society-Centered-Systems
This repository will structure current AI literature into a new Taxonomy which explores how Epistemology can effect AI's alignment with Humans and Society.


Our inspiration for this work was to explore the landscape of Philosophical opinions in current AI research and learn whether the epistemological stance taken by researchers has an effect on AI's alignment to social goals (human values).

First we conducted a brief search of epistemologies in order to provide us a frame of reference to search AI literature with.

Since there are so many different epistemologies, we started with their ontological categorisation. Stances were either thus: Objective, Subjective or Constructive.

Objective relates to the stance of Objectivism, which stipulates that understanding can be extracted by a subject, from an object and that knowledge is independent of the subject. This means the subject has no bearing on the understanding of phenomena (the understanding is a matter of fact and universally accepted).

Subjectivism relates to the stance that subjects play a role in generating understanding, meaning that subjects impart meaning on a phenomenon.

Constructivism relates to the stance that understanding is **constructed** by the interaction of a subject with an object (phenomenon).

Our Hypothesis going into this survey is that most AI work is objectivist-based work (CV, Optimisation). We expect to see some research projects acknowledging a subjective approach to research (i.e., human-centered design), however, we also expect these projects to be using Objective-based AI, meaning a clash of philosophies are present (perhaps for pragmatic reasons). Again we expect to see some research projects acknowledging a constructivist approach, whereby humans interact in a back-and-forth manner with AI to make a decision or prediction, however, few

To find Relevant Literature, we will use the following search strings:

- "Human?AI" OR "Human-Centered AI" OR "HCAI" OR "Artificial Intelligence
- AND
